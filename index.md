### CPSC 120

* [Lab 7](https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3381162/assignments/34637727) 

    Lab 7 was the first actually good logicall lab that we touch on. Especially at the black jack part 
    because it giving the logic of A could be 1 or 11 due to if it more than 10 or less than 10. Its 
    such a good concept where I have all the function name of the card name and number card.

* [Lab 10](https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3381162/assignments/34685849) 

    Lab 10 was the first other good one since it first talk about the new animation that we did toward 
    on making a certain pixel by pixel and getting RGB running accross the screen. Each function that we
    do have to be quite meticulous. They have a part 1 where it taking funtion of a rectangle and using other file 
    to run the code.

* [Lab 11](https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3381162/assignments/34727919)

    Lab 11 is quite a diffictult task because we having a vector array of bunch of states and which we need to write
    a code function to read through vector and getting that exact states populartiy. This is a such a amazing 
    code to write and to learn since it cooperating a lot of skill set that we learn through out the class.
